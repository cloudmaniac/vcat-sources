# VMware Cloud Architecture Toolkit for Service Providers

## Disclaimer

This an mock up of what could a GitHub Pages website look like for the future of **vCAT**. I have pre-filled some sections/pages with previous content that I converted into Markdown. The rendering (Markdown to HTML) is done by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the theme is [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).

Additional comments:

* The `Shortcodes` section in the side bar provides an overview of what is technically possible out of the box with this system in terms of rendering.
* I imported existing vCAT PDFs in the **Core Platform** and **Networking & Security** sections using PDF2Markdown applications (e.g., [Aspose](https://products.aspose.app/words/conversion/pdf-to-md)): the rendering is off the shelf (I didn't touch it).
* Some examples of collaboration: [Running a Collaborative Research Website and Blog with Jekyll and GitHub](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/collaborative-blog-with-jekyll-github)

## Contribute

**You can contribute by submitting a PR in the [source Git repository](https://github.com/cloudmaniac/vcat-sources): the actual content is in the `content` folder.**

If the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is correctly working, the website should be automatically updated a few seconds later.

## Overview

The **VMware vCloud Architecture Toolkit for Service Providers** (vCAT-SP) is a set of reference documents for VMware Cloud Providers. It is designed to help IT managers and architects construct cloud platforms and service offerings using current technologies, recommended practices, and innovative tools.

**vCAT-SP** provides attested, validated, and optimized design and support solutions with the most efficient examples to help you make the right choices for your business. vCAT-SP is aligned to the most common cloud service models that VMware Cloud Providers are deploying for their customers â€“ hosting, private cloud, and public cloud.

Est in vagis et Pittheus tu arge accipiter regia iram vocatur nurus. Omnes ut
olivae sensit **arma sorori** deducit, inesset **crudus**, ego vetuere aliis,
modo arsit? Utinam rapta fiducia valuere litora _adicit cursu_, ad facies

## Storage & Availability

Ea _furtique_ risere fratres edidit terrae magis. Colla tam mihi tenebat:
miseram excita suadent es pecudes iam. Concilio _quam_ velatus posset ait quod
nunc! Fragosis suae dextra geruntur functus vulgata.

## Hybridity

Epytus agis ait vixque clamat ornum adversam spondet, quid sceptra ipsum est. Reseret nec; saeva suo passu debentia linguam terga et aures et cervix de ubera. Coercet gelidumque manus, doluit volvitur induta?
